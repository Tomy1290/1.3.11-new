The previous AI engineer meticulously followed the user's iterative development requests for Scarletts Gesundheitstracking, an offline-first Android application. Initially, the core application structure, dashboard, and essential modules like Pills, Drinks, Weight, Goals, Chat, and Settings were established. Key decisions included using  for navigation,  with  for state management, and  for data visualization.

Subsequent phases focused on enhancing existing features and introducing new ones. The reminders system was fully implemented with local management and later upgraded to native OS notifications with auto-rescheduling and default times. The weight analysis gained daily delta views. A significant effort was dedicated to the gamification aspect, expanding achievements to over 40 distinct goals, removing the XP cap for open-ended leveling, and developing dedicated achievement list and detail pages with visual badges.

UX/Accessibility improvements, including adaptive themes, haptics, hit-slops, and an onboarding guide, were progressively integrated. The work concluded with the implementation of a comprehensive Saved Messages Manager and the initial setup for local notifications and extended achievement logic, including a basic combo system. The current focus is on finalizing gamification features like level rewards and offline seasonal events, and addressing offline AI features.

<current_work>
The application currently features a robust health tracking system. Phase 1, 2, and 3 have been completed. The core dashboard, daily navigation, and data persistence via MMKV are in place. Users can log pills, track drinks and sport activities, input and set goals for their weight, and view a 7/14/30-day or custom weight analysis with daily deltas. Reminders are fully functional with native OS notifications, including default times for pills, water, sport, and ginger-garlic-tea, and support for auto-rescheduling upon changes.

The gamification system is significantly advanced, with over 40 achievements across various categories, an open-ended XP/leveling system, a dashboard preview of the next 3 achievements, and dedicated list and detail pages with visual badge icons. A basic combo system provides bonus XP for simultaneous unlocks. The Saved Messages feature allows users to manage (CRUD) chat tips, with predefined and custom categories, tags, search, and filter capabilities. UX and accessibility improvements like adaptive themes, haptic feedback on key interactions, larger hit-slops for touch targets, and a 4-card onboarding miniguide have been integrated. The  version has been set to  (SDK 53 expected). The immediate work requested by the user is to finalize the gamification extras (Level Reward Gating, Seasonal Events, and offline Advanced AI features), which is currently in progress.
